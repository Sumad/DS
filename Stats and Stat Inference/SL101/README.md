# Stats and Statistical Inference Topics

## Probability  
- Basics of Probability : Random Experiment, Sample Space, Event, Mutually Exclusive events
- Conditional Probability
- Baye's Theorem

### Future Coverage
- Write a  function for birthday paradox under R101

## Probability Distributions, their PDF and parameters, and simulations with R, Degrees of freedom
- Discrete Distributions    
  - Binomial   
  - Poisson 
- Continuous Distributions
  - Normal  
  - t
  - ChiSquare
  - Fisher's (F)  
- Simulations with R make use of
  - rand set of functions : d(density), p(probability), q(quantile), r(random)
  - sample
  - approach to vectorize a function using vectorize, apply and sapply
  - layout to arrange plots on a single graph
  - ggplot: use of geom_density, facet_grid

### Future Coverage  
- Moments of distributions : location, scale, shape/skewness, peakedness/kurtosis 
- Add'l Continuous Dists. : exponential, Gamma, Tweedie, Weibull, lognormal
- PDFs of t,chisquare and f, plot of t and standard normal
- Put plots for F disribution on plots with a common y scale

## Central Limit Theorem   
-  Simulation of CLT using vectorization, data frame and list structures

## Hypothesis Testing
- Hypothesis testing for continuous measures like mean, proportion and variance
- Hypothesis testing for categorical measures like counts
- p value, decision errors, power of a test

### Future Coverage
- tests for proportions
- ANNOVA : one way and two way
- Chisquare test of independence
- non parametric tests for continuous measures when assumptions are violated
- plotting type1 and type2 errors on the same plot.
