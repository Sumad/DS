# Random Experiment : An activity that has an element of chance  with more than one outcome possible

# Sample Space : Set of elementary outcomes of the random experiment

# Event : A set defined from the elementary outcomes

# Probability of an event is then defined. Probability of an elementary outcome is simply 
 the no. of favorable outcomes/total possible outcomes

# Mutually Exclusive events

# Logical Operations to compute probability of a complex event
  # Break the event to elementary events, compute probability and join the probability with logical operations of AND, OR, NOT.
