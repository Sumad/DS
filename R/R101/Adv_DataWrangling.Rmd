# COMMON MATHEMATICS FUNCTIONS  
# THESE FUNCTIONS ARE VECTORIZED, I.E THEY WORK ON SCALARS, VECTOTS, DATA FRAMES
# sqrt()
# abs()
# floor()
# ceiling()
# trunc(34.99)
# round(34.993,digits =2 ) digits after decimal
# signif(34.993, digits = 4) significant digits
#cos(), sin(), tan() trig functions
#log(x = ,base = ) , log (x) is natural log
#exp(x)
```
