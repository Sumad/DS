# COMMON MATHEMATICS FUNCTIONS  
# THESE FUNCTIONS ARE VECTORIZED, I.E THEY WORK ON SCALARS, VECTOTS, DATA FRAMES
# sqrt()
# abs()
# floor()
# ceiling()
# trunc(34.99)
# round(34.993,digits =2 ) digits after decimal
# signif(34.993, digits = 4) significant digits
#cos(), sin(), tan() trig functions
#log(x = ,base = ) , log (x) is natural log
#exp(x)
```

```{r}
# STATISTICS FUNCTIONS
# CENTRAL TENDENCY
temp <- c(20,25,11,35,60, 25,11)
sort(temp)

mean(x = temp,trim = 0.05 ,na.rm = TRUE ) # can get trimmed mean after specifying a fraction
 # of observations to be trimmed from each end
median(x = temp,na.rm = TRUE )

# DEVIATION
mad(x = temp) # MEDIAN OF ABSOLUTE DEVIATIONS
sd(x = temp,na.rm = TRUE )
var(x = temp)
min(x = temp)
max(x = temp)
range(temp)
IQR(temp)

# RANK/POSITION
quantile(x = temp,probs = c(0.25,0.5,0.75,1)) # creates approx. quantiles
# like 25%ile is not 11+ 25%  (20-11) 

# LAGGED SERIES
diff(temp,    # Used to create lagged series, given a vector
     lag = 1 , # order of lag
     differences = 2) # order of difference

# CENTERING AND SCALING : scale() function
# IN GENERAL CENTERING A VARIABLE MEANS SUBTRACTING MEAN VALUES FROM ALL IT' VALUES,
# SCALING MEANS DIVIDING BY STANDARD DEVIATION

scale(x = temp,   # CAN OPERATE ON EACH COLUMN OF A MATRIX LIKE OBJECT
      center = TRUE, # EITHER LOGICAL OR NUMERIC VECTOR WITH VALUES TO USE FOR CENTERING INSTEAD OF MEAN
      scale = TRUE) # EITHER LOGICAL OR NUMERIC VECTOR WITH VALUES TO USE FOR SCALING.
   # IF CENTER IS TRUE, STD. DEVIATION IS USED FOR SCALING, ELSE RMS IS USED

# MOVING A SERIES TO A DESIRED MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION
#STEP1: STANDARDIZE THE SERIES using Z STATISTIC
#STEP 2: MULTIPLE SERIES BY DESIRED SD ( THIS DOES NOT CHANGES THE MEAN), 
#THEN ADD THE DESIRED MEAN TO SERIES (THIS DOES NOT CHANGES THE SD)

# PRPOERTY 1 :TO MOVE MEAN OF A SERIES BY K, ADD K TO EACH NUMBER, NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE SD
mean(temp)
mean(temp+5)  
sd(temp)
sd(temp+5)  

# PROPERTY 2: TO MAKE THE SD OF A SERIES K TIME, MULTIPLY THE SERIES BY K. MEAN ALSO BECOMES K TIMES 
sd(temp)
 sd(2*temp)
 mean(temp)
 mean(2*temp)
 

# EXAMPLE OF MOVING SERIES TO A MEAN OF 10 AND SD OF 5 
  
temp.new <- scale(x = temp,center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
temp.new2 <- temp.new * 5 + 10
mean(temp.new2)

# PRINT AND CAT - DIFFERENCES AND WHEN TO USE WHAT
# PRINT() CALLS A METHOD BASED ON THE CLASS OF THE OBJECT GIVEN AS ARGUMENT, AND RETURNS AN OBJECT 
# OF THE SAME CLASS
class(print(1:3))
class(print(c("a","b")))

# CAT() INTERNALLY TRIES TO CONVERT THE ARGUMENT/S TO CHARATCER VECTOR, CONCATENATEs
# AND OUTPUTS TO CONSOLE OR A FILE.IT CANNOT ON ACT ON COMPLEX OBJECTS LIKE LISTS,
# DATA FRAMES. IT IS VALID ONLY FOR ATOMIC DATA TYPES
# ALSO RETURNS OBJECT OF CLASS NULL, OUTPUT APPEARS CLEAN
#print()
#cat(... = ,file = ,fill = ,append = )
class(cat(1:3))
class(cat(c("a","b")))

# WHEN TO USE WHICH
#1.  USE CAT TO USE ESCAPE SEQUENCES: USING ESCAPE SEQUENCES IN CAT() MEANS, THEY ARE NOT RETURNED AS
# CHARACTER VECTORS AND ARE BROUGHT TO EFFECT BY CAT, BUT NOT BY PRINT
#2. USE CAT TO WRITE TO LOG FILES, MAKING USE OF ESCAPE SEQUENCES. OR USE IT'S UNFORMATTED OUTPUT
# TO COPY IT OVER TO OTHER PLACES
#3. USE PRINT WITH NON -ATOMIC CLASSES

```{r}
# SPECIAL CHARACTERS, ESCAPE SEQUENCES, NON-STANDARD NAMING OF VARIABLES

#1. SPECIAL CHARACTERS AND ESCAPE SEQUENCES
# SPECIAL CHARACTERS : \, "  HAVE RESERVED INTERPRETATION IN R, FOR THESE TO BE USED
# IN LITERAL SENSE IN CHARACTER VECTORS, EACH OF THEM NEED TO BE ESCAPED WITH A '\'

# x <- c("\", "'", """) # will throw an error
#x <- c("\m", "'") # will throw an error that \m is unrecognized esc seq
x <- c("\\", "'", "\"", "\\m") 
print(x) # RETURNS A CHARACTER VECTOR
cat(x) # RETURNS A NULL CLASS OBJECT, YOU CAN SEE THE CHARACTERS AS YOU WOULD ON
# KEYBOARD INPUT

# ESCAPE SEQUENCES:

# \n, \t, \b, \r, \f, \v have ascribed interpretations for keyboard inputs
# THESE CAN BE USED IN CHARACTER STRINGS

# EXAMPLES OF USING SPECIAL CHARACTER AND ESCAPE SEQUENCES:
# x <- "In ALGOL, you could do logical AND with /\."
# throws an error, because '\' character is interpreted as a special character
# in R, to use it as a normal character have to backlash it.

x <- "In ALGOL, you could do logical AND with /\\."
print(x)
cat(x) 

# SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO OUTPUTS FROM CAT
y <- c("tab:\\t", "newline:\\n", "escape:\\", "arbitrary string:\\s")
print(y)
cat(y)

y <- c("tab:\t", "newline:\n", "escape:\\", "arbitrary string:\\s")
print(y)
cat(y)

# USING QUOTES IN THE FINAL OUTOUT ON CONSOLE OR A FILE
x <- "My name is \"Sumad\""       
print(x)
cat(x)

#2. NON STANDARD NAMES - USE OF ``

`x y` <- 1:5
`x y`

```

```{r}
# COMMON CHARACTER MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS

vec <- c("Hello", "it has been very .. \\s slow going!" ,"Can we make itt fast??")
#1. nchar()
nchar(vec)  # length(vec[2]) will not count characters

#2. substr()
vec[2]
#grep(x =vec ,pattern = "y", value = FALSE)
#substr(x = ,start = ,stop = )

#3. grep  # Search a pattern and return the position where match was found 

#4. sub , gsub # FInd a pattern and substitie, can do global search and replace

#5. strsplit # split a string based on a pattern
# USED TO SPLIT A CHARACTER VECRTOR EITHER TO ITS CONSTITUENT CHARACTERS
# OR CREATE SPLITS BASED ON A PATTERN, RETURNS A LIST
str.split <- strsplit(x = vec[2], 
         fixed = TRUE, # FALSE if a regular expression pattern
         split = "")
str.split <- strsplit(x = vec[2], fixed = TRUE, split = "..")
str(str.split)

#6. paste () # pasting string together

#7. cat() # concatenate strings, also understands special quotes

#8. case change functions
